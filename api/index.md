# API Documentation

Here's an overview of the basic Resque API. Full API documentation can be found [on RubyDoc.info](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/resque).

## Creating Jobs

Resque jobs are any class that has a `#work` method:

```ruby
class SomeJob
  def work(foo, bar)
    # ...
  end
end
```

To enqueue a job, simply append it to a `Resque` object:

```ruby
resque = Resque.new
resque << SomeJob.new
```

## Creating Workers

Workers are processes that grab Jobs off of the queue and actually do the work.
To start up a worker, simply do this:

```
bin/resque work
```
